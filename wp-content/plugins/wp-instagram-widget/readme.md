## About

WP Instagram widget is a no fuss WordPress widget to showcase your latest Instagram pics. It does not require you to provide your login details or sign in via oAuth.

The widget is built with the following philosophy:

* Use sensible and simple markup
* Provide no styles/css - it is up to you to style the widget to your theme and taste
* Cache where possible - filters are provided to adjust cache timings
* Require little setup - avoid oAuth for example

## Installation

To install this plugin:

* Upload the `wp-instagram-widget` folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
* Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
* That's it!

Alternatively you can search for the plugin from your WordPress dashboard and install from there.

Visit [WordPress.org for a comprehensive guide](http://codex.wordpress.org/Managing_Plugins#Manual_Plugin_Installation) on in how to install WordPress plugins.

## Hooks & Filters

The plugin has five filters. The first allows you adjust that cache time for retrieving the images from Instagram:

```
add_filter('null_instagram_cache_time', 'my_cache_time');

function my_cache_time() {
	return HOUR_IN_SECONDS;
}
```

The second allows you to filter video results from the widget:

```
add_filter('wpiw_images_only', '__return_true');
```

The rest allow you to add custom classes to the [ul] list container, each list item, link or image:

```
add_filter( 'wpiw_list_class', 'my_instagram_class' );

add_filter( 'wpiw_item_class', 'my_instagram_class' );
add_filter( 'wpiw_a_class', 'my_instagram_class' );
add_filter( 'wpiw_img_class', 'my_instagram_class' );
add_filter( 'wpiw_linka_class', 'my_instagram_class' );

function my_instagram_class( $classes ) {
	$classes = "instagram-image";
	return $classes;
}
```

In version 1.3 you also have two new hooks for adding custom output before and after the widget:

```
wpiw_before_widget
wpiw_after_widget
```

In version 1.4 and above you can also customise the image loop completely by creating a `parts/wp-instagram-widget.php` file in your theme.

In version 1.9.6 you can now use a filter to change the location of your custom template part: `wpiw_template_part`.
